# Pokemon-Legends-Bot
This is my simple Python Bot that I use to find rare Pokemons in Pokemon Legends (https://www.pokemonlegends.com/). You can see the demo video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISfILLo_f1k 
You need Seleneium, Python and geckodriver to be in your Path Variable.
It uses existing Mozilla FIrefox profile that I created. You can change the Profile directory in settings.py file.
The whole project is made in PyCharm. Simply, downlaod it and open it with PyCharm to modify.
